- [x] Perform a semantic codebase search to map out all code paths where context size (`NumCtx`) is set, overridden, or passed to the backend, and where the GGUF context length is read and compared.
- [x] Identify all relevant code locations and logic for `NumCtx` initialization, modification, and usage.
- [x] Find where the GGUF context length is loaded and how it is used to limit or set the effective context.
- [x] Document the flow from configuration/env/CLI to backend invocation, including any runtime adjustments.
- [x] Highlight where changes would be needed to support dynamic context sizing up to the model's maximum.
- [x] Create a detailed plan for dynamic `NumCtx` sizing, including a Mermaid diagram.
- [x] Write the issue and plan to `ISSUE.md` and `PLAN.md`.
- [x] Implement the dynamic `NumCtx` sizing.
- [x] Formulate a plan for updating tests.
- [x] Implement the test updates.
- [x] Investigate `NumPredict = -1` behavior and its effect on context calculation.
- [x] Investigate and resolve `NumCtx` scaling and preservation failures in `sched_test.go`.
- [x] Fix `NumCtx` scaling in `server/sched.go` (`pickBestFullFitByLibrary` and `pickBestPartialFitByLibrary`).
- [x] Investigate test failures and identify root cause of `NumCtx` calculation inconsistencies.
- [x] **CRITICAL DESIGN ISSUE**: Architectural review required for `NumCtx` dynamic calculation inconsistency between `GenerateHandler` and `ChatHandler` (see `ISSUE.md`).
- [x] Implement dynamic `NumCtx` calculation in `ChatHandler` by refactoring existing logic into a reusable function in `server/routes.go`.
- [x] Update `server/routes_generate_test.go` to include new test cases for `ChatHandler` and ensure existing tests pass with unified behavior.
- [x] **FIX TEST EXPECTATIONS**: Update test cases to match current PLAN.md requirements (numPredict: nil should use remaining context, not 1024 default).
- [x] **FIX MOCK SERVER CAPTURE**: Investigate and fix mock server timing issue to properly capture dynamic NumCtx values from final scheduler calls.
- [ ] **INVESTIGATE AND FIX REGRESSIONS**: Address new test failures introduced by recent changes.
